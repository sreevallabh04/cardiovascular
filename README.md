# 🏥 AI-Driven Risk Prediction Engine for Chronic Care Patients

## 🏆 Hackathon Winning Solution

This repository contains a comprehensive AI-driven risk prediction engine that forecasts cardiovascular deterioration risk in chronic care patients over a 90-day horizon.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Chronic conditions such as diabetes, obesity, and heart failure require continuous monitoring and proactive care. Despite access to vitals, lab results, and medication adherence data, predicting when a patient may deteriorate remains a major challenge.

**Our Solution**: A reliable and explainable AI-driven system that empowers clinicians and care teams to intervene earlier, improve health outcomes, and reduce hospitalization risks.
