# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## ðŸš€ Manual GitHub Repository Creation

Since GitHub CLI is not installed, follow these steps to create and push your repository:

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Repository name: `cardiovascular-risk-prediction`
5. Description: `ML system for predicting cardiovascular deterioration risk in chronic care patients with 90-day horizon. Features SHAP explainability, clinical dashboard, and production-ready error handling.`
6. Make it **Public**
7. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
8. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub
Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cardiovascular-risk-prediction.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Upload
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Verify all files are uploaded:
   - `cardiovascular_risk_prediction.ipynb`
   - `run_analysis.py`
   - `README.md`
   - `requirements.txt`
   - `model_diagnostics.csv`
   - All CSV data files
